        <h1>about gucci</h1>
        <p>Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci (1881-1953) in Florence, Tuscany. Under the direction of Aldo Gucci (son of Guccio), Gucci became a worldwide-known brand, an icon of the Italian dolce vita period. Following family feuds during the 1980s, the Gucci family was entirely ousted from the capital of the company by 1993. After this crisis, the brand was revived and in 1999 Gucci became a subsidiary of the French conglomerate PPR, which later renamed itself to Kering.
           in 2023, Gucci operated 538 stores with 20,711 employees, and generated â‚¬9.9 billion in sales.[7] Stefano Cantino
           has been CEO of Gucci since October 2024,[8] and Sabato De Sarno creative director since January 2023.[9][10]</p>
